## Run my experiment using VMs
<!-- Get resources -->
First, reserve your resources. For this experiment, we will use a topology of a 7 nodes&mdash;a malicious client, a benign client, the resolver, two malicious authoritative servers, a benign authoritative server, and a root authoritative server. Your complete topology will be:
<!-- image of topology -->
![vm_ex_topology](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98507fc7-db63-4ed3-86bc-96319975a319)

To reserve these resources on Cloudlab, open this profile page:
<!-- link to pre-established CloudLab profile -->
[https://www.cloudlab.us/p/nyunetworks/NRDelegationAttack](https://www.cloudlab.us/p/nyunetworks/NRDelegationAttack)

Click "Next", then select the Cloudlab project that you are part of and a Cloudlab cluster with available resources. Then click "Next", and "Finish".

Wait until all of the sources have turned green and have a small check mark in the top right corner of the "Topology View" tab, indicating that they are fully configured and ready to log in. Then, click on "List View" to get SSH login details for the hosts. Use these details to SSH into each.

When you have logged in to each node, continue to the next section to configure your resources.

<!-- Configure resources -->
### Configure resources
In your choice of terminal application, open a window for each of the seven nodes.

#### Client machines
The experiment will use the resperf[4] tool to send queries, both malicious and benign, at a fixed rate and track the response rate from the resolver. SSH into the malicious-client and benign-client nodes and run
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev libldns-dev libck-dev libnghttp2-dev
wget https://www.dns-oarc.net/files/dnsperf/dnsperf-2.8.0.tar.gz
tar xzf dnsperf-2.8.0.tar.gz
cd dnsperf-2.8.0
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
on both client machines to install Resperf.

For the resperf tool, we need to provide input files containing a list of queries. On the malicious-client run
```
cd ~
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/reproduction/genAttackNamesToCheck.py ~
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/reproduction/genBenignNamesToCheck.py ~
python genAttackNamesToCheck.py
python genBenignNamesToCheck.py
```
to generate an `attackerNames.txt` file with a list of malicious names and a `benignNames.txt` file with a list of benign names.

And On the benign-client run
```
cd ~
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/reproduction/genBenignNamesToCheck.py ~
python genBenignNamesToCheck.py
```
to generate the `benignNames.txt` file.

#### Resolver
Next, we will install BIND9[5], an open-source implementation of the DNS protocol, on the resolver. SSH into the resolver node and run
```
git clone -b 9_16_6 https://github.com/ShaniBenAtya/bind9.git 
cd bind9 
sudo apt update 
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-ply libuv1-dev pkg-config autoconf automake libtool libssl-dev libcap-dev
autoreconf -fi 
./configure 
make -j 4
sudo make install
```
to install BIND9.16.6. Now provide the necessary directories and configuration files by running:
```
sudo touch /usr/local/etc/named.conf
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/resolver/named.conf /usr/local/etc/named.conf
sudo touch /usr/local/etc/db.root
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/resolver/db.root /usr/local/etc/db.root
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/var/cache/bind
cd /usr/local/etc; sudo rndc-confgen -a
```
You can verify the installation by running `named -v` and should this message:
```
BIND 9.16.6 (Stable Release)
```
We use version 9.16.6 because it is a NXNS-patched version and most vulnerable to the NRDelegationAttack.

#### Authoritative nameservers
The authoritative servers will use Name Server Daemon (NSD), an open-source implementation of an authoritative DNS nameserver. 

To configure the malicious referral authoritative, the authoritative server that responds to queries with the malicious referral response, SSH into the malicious-ref-server node and run:
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nsd
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/nsd_attack/referral.lan.forward /etc/nsd/referral.lan.forward
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/nsd_attack/referral.lan.reverse /etc/nsd/referral.lan.reverse
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/nsd_attack/nsd.conf /etc/nsd/nsd.conf
```
to move the zone and configuration files used by NSD into the correct directory. To install NSD on the server, run:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y nsd
```
When prompted with the following message:
```
Configuration file '/etc/nsd/nsd.conf'
 ==> File on system created by you or by a script.
 ==> File also in package provided by package maintainer.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** nsd.conf (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? N
```
choose "N" to use the configuration file we created in the previous step. After the installation you might get the message:
```
Job for nsd.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status nsd.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.
invoke-rc.d: initscript nsd, action "start" failed.
‚óè nsd.service - Name Server Daemon

    Process: 2126 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nsd -d (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)
   Main PID: 2126 (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)
```
The following steps will handle the error. To finish configuring the server, add the necessary directories and permissions for NSD:
```
sudo mkdir -p /run/nsd /var/db/nsd
sudo touch /run/nsd/nsd.pid /var/db/nsd/nsd.db
sudo chown -R nsd:nsd /run/nsd /var/db/nsd
```

To configure the malicious delegation authoritative, the authoritative server that responds to queries with the IP address of a DNS non-responsive server, SSH into the malicious-del-server node and run:
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nsd
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/nsd_attack2/delegation.lan.forward /etc/nsd/delegation.lan.forward
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/nsd_attack2/delegation.lan.reverse /etc/nsd/delegation.lan.reverse
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/nsd_attack2/nsd.conf /etc/nsd/nsd.conf
```
to load the zone and configuration files into the correct directory. Next, install NSD on the server by running:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y nsd
```
When prompted about the `etc/nsd/nsd.conf` configuration file, choose 'N' to keep your currently-installed version. Once NSD is installed run:
```
sudo mkdir -p /run/nsd /var/db/nsd
sudo touch /run/nsd/nsd.pid /var/db/nsd/nsd.db
sudo chown -R nsd:nsd /run/nsd /var/db/nsd
```
to finish the server configuration.

To configure the benign server, SSH into the benign-server node and run:
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nsd
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/nsd_benign/benign.lan.forward /etc/nsd/benign.lan.forward
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/nsd_benign/benign.lan.reverse /etc/nsd/benign.lan.reverse
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/nsd_benign/nsd.conf /etc/nsd/nsd.conf
```
to load the zone and configuration files into the correct directory. Install NSD on the server by running:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y nsd
```
When prompted about the `etc/nsd/nsd.conf` configuration file, choose 'N' to keep your currently-installed version. Once NSD is installed run:
```
sudo mkdir -p /run/nsd /var/db/nsd
sudo touch /run/nsd/nsd.pid /var/db/nsd/nsd.db
sudo chown -R nsd:nsd /run/nsd /var/db/nsd
```
to finish the server configuration.

And to configure the root server, SSH into the root-server node and run:
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nsd
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/nsd_root/net.forward /etc/nsd/net.forward
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/nsd_root/net.reverse /etc/nsd/net.reverse
sudo cp /local/repository/vm_experiment/nsd_root/nsd.conf /etc/nsd/nsd.conf
```
to load the zone and configuration files into the correct directory. And install NSD on the server by running:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y nsd
```
When prompted about the `etc/nsd/nsd.conf` configuration file, choose 'N' to keep your currently-installed version. Once NSD is installed, run:
```
sudo mkdir -p /run/nsd /var/db/nsd
sudo touch /run/nsd/nsd.pid /var/db/nsd/nsd.db
sudo chown -R nsd:nsd /run/nsd /var/db/nsd
```
to finish the server configuration.

When you have finished installing the necessary files and software on each node, continue to the next section to verify your setup.

### Verify Setup
We can perform a basic test, issuing queries and recording the resolution route, to check if the setup is ready and well configured.

#### Malicious client query
During the experiment, the malicious-client will issue queries that rely on the malicious referral response from the malicious-ref-server (.referral.lan domain). Queries for the .referral.lan domain should go to the resolver and the resolver should access the malicious-ref-server through the root-server.
![mal_test_route](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd3f933d-37cb-4bef-b04e-06c10cc20809)
We can perform an example query for a .referral.lan name to test this resolution route.

Open eight terminal windows: SSH into the seven nodes and SSH into the resolver again in the eighth terminal.

To start the resolver, run
```
sudo named -g
```
And start the servers by running
```
sudo nsd -c /etc/nsd/nsd.conf -d -f /var/db/nsd/nsd.db
```
on each server.

In the second resolver terminal, start a tcpdump to capture DNS traffic:
```
sudo tcpdump -i any -s 65535 port 53 -w ~/malicious_verify
```
Next, from the malicious-client, query the resolver for the IP address of `firewall.referral.lan`. Run
```
dig firewall.referral.lan. @10.0.2.1
```
You should get a response with `10.0.0.207`&mdash;the IP address of `firewall.referral.lan`:
```
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;firewall.referral.lan.             IN      A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
firewall.referral.lan.      86400   IN      A       10.0.0.207
```
After receiving the response, stop the resolver, the servers, and the tcpdump (you can use Ctrl + C).

To view the output file from the packet capture, in the resolver terminal, run
```
tshark -r ~/malicious_verify
```
You will see the entire DNS resolution route for the IP address associated with the name `firewall.referral.lan`:

```
- firewall.home.lan query from client to resolver (from ip 10.0.2.200 to ip 10.0.2.1)
- resolver query to the root server (from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.101)
- root-server return the ".referral.lan" address (from 10.0.0.101 to 10.0.0.1)
- resolver query the ".referral.lan" (malicious-ref-server) address (from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.200)
- malicious-ref-server return the address (10.0.0.207) for the domain name "firewall.referral.lan" (from 10.0.0.200 to 10.0.0.1)
- resolver return the address (10.0.0.207) to the client (from 10.0.2.1 to 10.0.2.200)

The address `firewall.referral.lan` is configured in the zone file of the malicious-ref-server (10.0.0.200) and this test ensures that the resolver (10.0.2.1 interface with malicious-client, 10.0.0.1 interface with servers) accesses the authoritative servers through the root (10.0.0.101).

(In our experiment, the benign-client will not issue queries for names serviced by the malicious domains, but you can still observe the resolution route by running `dig firewall.referral.lan. @10.0.1.1` from the benign-client. The only difference in the route will be the IP addresses of the client and the resolver/client interface).

#### Benign client query
During the experiment, the benign-client will issue queries that rely on the b-server (.benign.lan domain). Queries for the .benign.lan domain should go to the resolver and the resolver should access the benign-server through the root-server.
![ben_test_route](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cd4a9fc-a466-4b62-909d-fe9994bf0bf4)
We can perform an example query for a .benign.lan name to test this resolution route.

Open eight terminal windows: SSH into the seven nodes and SSH into the resolver again in the eighth terminal.

To start the resolver, run
```
sudo named -g
```
And start the servers by running
```
sudo nsd -c /etc/nsd/nsd.conf -d -f /var/db/nsd/nsd.db
```
on each server.

In the second resolver terminal, start a tcpdump to capture DNS traffic:
```
sudo tcpdump -i any -s 65535 port 53 -w ~/benign_verify
```
Next, from the benign-client, query the resolver for the IP address of `firewall.benign.lan`. Run
```
dig firewall.benign.lan. @10.0.1.1
```
You should get a response with `10.0.0.240`&mdash;the IP address of `firewall.benign.lan`:
```

```
- firewall.home.lan query from client to resolver (from ip 10.0.1.100 to ip 10.0.1.1)
- resolver query to the root server (from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.101)
- root-server return the ".benign.lan" address (from 10.0.0.101 to 10.0.0.1)
- resolver query the ".benign.lan" (benign-server) address (from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.100)
- benign-server return the address (10.0.0.240) for the domain name "firewall.benign.lan" (from 10.0.0.100 to 10.0.0.1)
- resolver return the address (10.0.0.240) to the client (from 10.0.1.1 to 10.0.1.100)

The address `firewall.benign.lan` is configured in the zone file of the benign-server (10.0.0.100) and this test ensures that the resolver (10.0.1.1 interface with benign-client, 10.0.0.1 interface with servers) accesses the authoritative servers through the root (10.0.0.101).

(You can observe the resolution route for a benign query issued by the malicious-client by running `dig firewall.benign.lan. @10.0.2.1` from the malicious-client. The only difference in the route will be the IP addresses of the client and the resolver/client interface).

### Instructions measurement experiment - NXNS-patched resolver

We will refer to the cost of a NRDelegation query as the number of resolver CPU instructions executed during a malicious query. This experiment will measure the CPU instructions executed on a NXNS-patched resolver (BIND9.16.6) during a malicious query compared to a benign query. The number of instructions will be recorded by an instance of the callgrind tool in the command to start the resolver.

Make sure the resolver is configured to use BIND9.16.6. Run `named -v` to check the version. If the resolver is using a different version, run:
```bash
cd bind9
make install
```
to change the version to BIND9.16.6.

Turn on the resolver with Valgrind's callgrind tool by running
```bash
sudo valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=mal_nxns_patched named -g
```
We use `--tool=callgrind` to specify that we are using the callgrind tool. `named` is the BIND9 service and `/etc/named.conf` is the configuration file.

Turn on the authoritative servers by running 
```bash
sudo nsd -c /etc/nsd/nsd.conf -d -f /var/db/nsd/nsd.db
```
in each server terminal. 

From the malicious client, query the resolver (interface IP 10.0.2.1) with a malicious query:
```bash
dig attack0.referral.lan. @10.0.2.1
```
The malicious referral response contains 1500 records that delegate the resolution of `attack0.referral.lan` to a DNS non-responsive server. You will not receive a resolution for the name `attack.referral.lan` because the resolver was directed to resolve the name at a server incapable of responding to the DNS queries.

Stop the resolver (Ctrl+C) and restart it with the Valgrind tool:
```bash
sudo valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=benign_nxns_patched named -g
```

Now, from the benign client, query the resolver with a legitimate query:
```bash
dig b0.benign.lan. @10.0.1.1
```
You should receive a response with the IP address of `b0.benign.lan` (10.0.0.110).
```
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;b0.benign.lan.                 IN      A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
b0.benign.lan.          86400   IN      A  10.0.0.110
```
After receiving the response, stop the resolver.

In Cloudlab, open the VNC window on the resolver node and run
```bash
sudo kcachegrind mal_nxns_patched
```
to open the malicious query results file with the KCachegrind tool. And run
```bash
sudo kcachegrind benign_nxns_patched
```
to open the benign query results file.

In the KCachegrind interface, make sure the "Relative" button is unchecked and choose the "Instructions Fetch" tab. Record the "Incl." value of the `fctx_getaddresses` function for both results files. Compare the results. The benign query should be around 200,000 instructions, while the malicious query should have more than 2,000,000,000.

### Instructions measurement experiment - NXNS-unpatched resolver

This experiment follows the instructions from the NXNS-patched experiment, but uses a BIND9.16.2 resolver, which is an NXNS-unpatched resolver, instead of a BIND9.16.6 resolver. 

To change the BIND9 version, run
```bash
cd bind9_16_2
make install
```
to configure the resolver to use BIND9.16.2.

Turn on the resolver with Valgrind's callgrind tool by running
```bash
sudo valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=mal_nxns_unpatched named -g
```

If the authoritative servers are not running (you can check if the `nsd` process is running with the `ps aux | grep nsd` command), run 
```bash
sudo nsd -c /etc/nsd/nsd.conf -d -f /var/db/nsd/nsd.db
```
in each server terminal.

From the malicious client, query the resolver (interface IP 10.0.2.1) with a malicious query:
```bash
dig attack0.referral.lan. @10.0.2.1
```
The malicious referral response contains 1500 records that delegate the resolution of `attack0.referral.lan` to a DNS non-responsive server. You will not receive a resolution for the name `attack.referral.lan` because the resolver was directed to resolve the name at a server incapable of responding to the DNS queries.

Stop the resolver (Ctrl+C) and restart it with the Valgrind tool:
```bash
sudo valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=benign_nxns_unpatched named -g
```

Now, from the benign client, query the resolver with a legitimate query:
```bash
dig b0.benign.lan. @10.0.1.1
```
You should receive a response with the IP address of `b0.benign.lan` (10.0.0.110).
```
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;b0.benign.lan.                 IN      A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
b0.benign.lan.          86400   IN      A  10.0.0.110
```
After receiving the response, stop the resolver.

In Cloudlab, open the VNC window on the resolver node and run
```bash
sudo kcachegrind mal_nxns_unpatched
```
to open the malicious query results file with the KCachegrind tool. And run
```bash
sudo kcachegrind benign_nxns_unpatched
```
to open the benign query results file.

In the KCachegrind interface, make sure the "Relative" button is unchecked and choose the "Instructions Fetch" tab. Record the "Incl." value of the `fctx_getaddresses` function for both results files. Compare the results. The benign query should be around 200,000 instructions, while the malicious query should be around 200,000,000.

### Instructions measurement experiment - NRDelegation-patched resolver

This experiment follows the instructions from the NXNS-patched experiment, but uses a BIND9.16.33 resolver, which is a NRDelegation-patched resolver, instead of a BIND9.16.6 resolver. 

To change the BIND9 version, run
```bash
cd bind9_16_33
make install
```
to configure the resolver to use BIND9.16.33.

Turn on the resolver with Valgrind's callgrind tool by running
```bash
sudo valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=mal_nrdelegation_patched named -g
```

If the authoritative servers are not running (you can check if the `nsd` process is running with the `ps aux | grep nsd` command), run 
```bash
sudo nsd -c /etc/nsd/nsd.conf -d -f /var/db/nsd/nsd.db
```
in each server terminal.

From the malicious client, query the resolver (interface IP 10.0.2.1) with a malicious query:
```bash
dig attack0.referral.lan. @10.0.2.1
```
The malicious referral response contains 1500 records that delegate the resolution of `attack0.referral.lan` to a DNS non-responsive server. You will not receive a resolution for the name `attack.referral.lan` because the resolver was directed to resolve the name at a server incapable of responding to the DNS queries.

Stop the resolver (Ctrl+C) and restart it with the Valgrind tool:
```bash
sudo valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=benign_nrdelegation_patched named -g
```

Now, from the benign client, query the resolver with a legitimate query:
```bash
dig b0.benign.lan. @10.0.1.1
```
You should receive a response with the IP address of `b0.benign.lan` (10.0.0.110).
```
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;b0.benign.lan.                 IN      A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
b0.benign.lan.          86400   IN      A  10.0.0.110
```
After receiving the response, stop the resolver.

In Cloudlab, open the VNC window on the resolver node and run
```bash
sudo kcachegrind mal_nrdelegation_patched
```
to open the malicious query results file with the KCachegrind tool. And run
```bash
sudo kcachegrind benign_nrdelegation_patched
```
to open the benign query results file.

In the KCachegrind interface, make sure the "Relative" button is unchecked and choose the "Instructions Fetch" tab. Record the "Incl." value of the `fctx_getaddresses` function for both results files. Compare the results. The benign query should be around 200,000 instructions, while the malicious query should be around 10,000,000.

### Throughput measurement experiment
The goal of the attacker during the NRDelegation is to consume resources, preventing the resolver from servicing benign clients. To observe the impact of the attack on victims, you will run two "sub"-experiments. 

The first experiment will test the effect of the attack on benign client throughput. Benign and malicious commands will be executed with an instance of the Resperf tool on the respective client. The malicious command will simulate the attacker and issue malicious queries at a fixed rate, while the benign command will issue the benign requests until failure.

The second experiment will test the throughput without any attack. Commands will be executed with the resperf tool on each client, and both the benign and malicious commands will issue benign requests.

In the following tests, the malicious user command should be run first, but ultimately in parallel, to the benign user command. 

SSH into the seven nodes.

From the resolver, run
```
sudo named -g
```
to start BIND9 on the resolver.

For each of the four authoritative servers, run
```
sudo nsd -c /etc/nsd/nsd.conf -d -f /var/db/nsd/nsd.db
```
to start NSD on the servers.

From the malicious-client, run
```
resperf -d attackerNames.txt -s 10.0.2.1 -v -m 15000 -c 60 -r 0 -R -P ~/with_attack
```
where `-d attackerNames.txt` is the input file with a list of queries that rely on the malicious referral response, and these queries are sent to the resolver with IP address `-s 10.0.2.1` at a rate of `-m 15000` queries per second, for a duration of `-c 60` seconds, sending the packets in constant time after ramping up for `-r 0`seconds. The output file `with_attack` will show the results of this test.

From the benign-client machine, run
```
resperf -d benignNames.txt -s 10.0.1.1 -v -R -P ~/with_attack
```
where `-d benignNames.txt` is the input file with a list of benign names serviced by the benign-server, `-s 10.0.1.1` is the resolver IP address, and `with_attack` is the output file.

Once the commands have finished executing, stop the resolver (Ctrl + C) in order to clear the cache. Restart the resolver with `named -g`.

Next, to measure the throughput without any attack, "benignNames.txt" will be used as the input file for both commands (no malicious queries will be issued).

From the malicious-client run
```
resperf -d benignNames.txt -s 10.0.2.1 -v -m 15000 -c 60 -r 0 -R -P ~/no_attack
```
and from the benign-client run
```
resperf -d benignNames.txt -s 10.0.1.1 -v -R -P ~/no_attack
```

<!-- Analyze results -->
To view the results, open only the benign-client output files from both sub-experiments (`with_attack` and `no_attack`). Compare the benign user throughput, the "actual_qps" versus the "responses_per_sec" column, between the two tests. In ideal conditions, the responses per second should match the actual queries per second. In real network conditions without any malicious actors, there might be slight variation between queries and responses per second. During the NRDelegationAttack, you should observe a degradation in the resolver throughput for benign clients, indicated by 0 responses per seconds.

## Notes

### Debugging Tips
<!-- debugging tips -->
If there is an error stating that the port is already in use when starting NSD on the authoritative servers, run `ps aux | grep nsd` and identify the process IDs. Run `sudo kill <ID>`. Start the server again.

If you receive a `status: SERVFAIL` response when verifying the setup or when issuing benign queries, run `ps aux | grep nsd` on each server to check if NSD is running. If there are no NSD processes on the server, run `sudo nsd -c /etc/nsd/nsd.conf -d -f /var/db/nsd/nsd.db` to start the server.
