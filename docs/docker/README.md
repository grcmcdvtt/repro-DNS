## Run my experiment using Docker containers
<!-- Get resources -->
This experiment will measure the cost of a malicious NRDelegationAttack query in instructions executed on the resolver CPU. For this experiment, we will use a topology of a single node:

![docker_ex_topology](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e29def83-8bc5-4d78-b17c-29d7ecdb7a1d)

Open this profile page: [https://www.cloudlab.us/p/PortalProfiles/small-lan](https://www.cloudlab.us/p/PortalProfiles/small-lan) 

Click "Next", then choose 1 node, select UBUNTU 20.04 as the disk image, and check the box for "Start X11 VNC on your nodes".
![Screenshot 2024-08-04 184446](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/608e65d3-8f67-4ad6-8f66-9d66110f497d)
Click "Next", then select the Cloudlab project that you are part of and a Cloudlab cluster with available resources. Click "Next" and then "Finish".

It will take a few minutes for your resources to be allocated. Wait until the node has turned green with a check mark in the upper right corner in the "Topology View" tab signaling that your node is ready for you to log in. Then, click on "List View" to get SSH login details for the host. Use these details to SSH into the node.

When you have logged in to each node, continue to the next section to configure your resources.

### Configure Resources

Once you have logged into your node, run:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```
to install Docker.

You can verify that the Docker Engine installation was successful by running the hello-world image:
```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```
If the installation is working correctly you should see:
```
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
c1ec31eb5944: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:1408fec50309afee38f3535383f5b09419e6dc0925bc69891e79d84cc4cdcec6
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.
```

To pull the docker image used in the experiment from Docker Hub run:
```bash
sudo docker pull shanist/dnssim:1.7
```

To install tshark, run:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y tshark
```
We will use tshark to view network packet captures. By viewing the captures, we can see the resolution route of queries.

The docker environment has Valgrind's callgrind tool pre-installed. This tool records the call history among functions and will be used to record the number of instructions executed on the r on the resolver during queries. We will use the KCachegrind tool for viewing the results files generated by callgrind. Run:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y kcachegrind
```
to install KCachegrind.

When you have finished installing the necessary software dependencies, continue to the next section to verify your setup.

### Turn on the environment

<!-- screen session -->
This experiment requires you have 6 terminal windows open&mdash;1 terminal will be a terminal on the host node, and 5 terminals will be docker environment terminals. In this experiment the terminals will be referred to as follows:
- Terminal 1: Host
- Terminal 2: Resolver
- Terminal 3: Root server
- Terminal 4: Malicious server
- Terminal 5: Client 1
- Terminal 6: Client 2

Open 6 terminal windows, and SSH into the host node in each window.

In the Resolver terminal, run the docker interactively so you can control the environment
```bash
sudo docker container run --dns 127.0.0.1 --mount type=bind,source=$(eval echo ~),target=/app -it shanist/dnssim:1.7 /bin/bash
```
You will now have a terminal inside the environment. 

Next, from Host terminal, run
```
CONTAINER_ID=$(sudo docker container ls -q --filter ancestor=shanist/dnssim:1.7)
```
This creates a variable that stores the CONTAINER_ID of your docker container. The CONTAINER_ID will be used throughout this experiment. Now that we have the CONTAINER_ID, we can open the remaining instances of the docker environment.

In Terminals 3-6 (Root server, Malicious server, and both clients), run
```bash
sudo docker exec -it $CONTAINER_ID bash
```
You should now have a terminal console on the host node, and 5 consoles in the docker environment.

First, turn on the resolver. In the Resolver terminal, run:
```bash
cd /etc
named -g -c /etc/named.conf
```
The environment is pre-installed with Bind 9.16.6, the NXNS-patched resolver implementation. You can view the version by running `named -v`.

Next, in the Root server terminal, run:
```bash
cd /env/nsd_root
nsd -c nsd.conf -d -f nsd.db
```
to turn on the root authoritative server. 

In Malicious server terminal, run
```bash
cd /env/nsd_attack
nsd -c nsd.conf -d -f nsd.db
```
to turn on the malicious authoritative server. 

See the Debugging Tips section if you encountered an error when turning on the server(s).

### Verify the setup
Now that our resolver and authoritative servers are running, we can perform a basic test to check if the setup is ready and well configured.

In the Client 1 terminal, run
```bash
tcpdump -i lo -s 65535 -w /app/dump port 53
```
to start a network capture of DNS traffic.

In Client 2 terminal, run
```bash
dig firewall.home.lan
```
to query the resolver for the IP address of `firewall.home.lan `.

Check that the correct IP address (127.0.0.207) was received in response. You should see the following sections:
```
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;firewall.home.lan.             IN      A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
firewall.home.lan.      86400   IN      A  127.0.0.207
```

Stop the `tcpdump`, the resolver, and the authoritative servers (you can use Ctrl+C in each terminal).

In the Host terminal, run
```bash
sudo tshark -r ~/dump
```
to view the `dump` file with the results of the capture. 

You should observe the whole DNS resolution route for the name `firewall.home.lan`:
```
1   0.000000    127.0.0.1 → 127.0.0.1    DNS 100 Standard query 0xd6ef A firewall.home.lan OPT # firewall.home.lan query from client to resolver
2   0.014105    127.0.0.1 → 127.0.0.2    DNS 82 Standard query 0x24cc NS <Root> OPT # Resolver query to the root server
3   0.014198    127.0.0.2 → 127.0.0.1    DNS 117 Standard query response 0x24cc NS <Root> NS a.root-servers.net A 127.0.0.2 OPT
4   0.014459    127.0.0.1 → 127.0.0.2    DNS 88 Standard query 0x6223 A _.lan OPT
5   0.014513    127.0.0.2 → 127.0.0.1    DNS 129 Standard query response 0x6223 No such name A _.lan SOA root-servers.net OPT
6   0.018196    127.0.0.1 → 127.0.0.2    DNS 93 Standard query 0xaf30 A _.home.lan OPT
7   0.018259    127.0.0.2 → 127.0.0.1    DNS 115 Standard query response 0xaf30 A _.home.lan NS ns1.home.lan A 127.0.0.200 OPT # Root server return the SLD address
8   0.019481    127.0.0.1 → 127.0.0.200  DNS 100 Standard query 0x5ea5 A firewall.home.lan OPT # Resolver query the SLD
9   0.019571  127.0.0.200 → 127.0.0.1    DNS 172 Standard query response 0x5ea5 A firewall.home.lan A 127.0.0.207 NS ns1.home.lan NS ns2.home.lan A 127.0.0.200 A 127.0.0.212 OPT # SLD return the address for the domain name
10   0.019837    127.0.0.1 → 127.0.0.2    DNS 95 Standard query 0x83a6 AAAA ns1.home.lan OPT
11   0.019890    127.0.0.2 → 127.0.0.1    DNS 113 Standard query response 0x83a6 AAAA ns1.home.lan NS ns1.home.lan A 127.0.0.200 OPT
12   0.020531    127.0.0.1 → 127.0.0.200  DNS 95 Standard query 0x669e AAAA ns1.home.lan OPT
13   0.020589  127.0.0.200 → 127.0.0.1    DNS 125 Standard query response 0x669e AAAA ns1.home.lan SOA ns1.home.lan OPT
14   0.021067    127.0.0.1 → 127.0.0.1    DNS 132 Standard query response 0xd6ef A firewall.home.lan A 127.0.0.207 OPT # Resolver return the address to the client
```
The address `firewall.home.lan` is configured in the zone file of the attack server, and this test ensures that the resolver (127.0.0.1) accesses the attack authoritative server (127.0.0.200) through the root (127.0.0.2) and then returns the IP address to the client (127.0.0.1 - the resolver and client have the same IP address).

### Instructions measurement experiment - NXNS-patched resolver

This experiment will measure the CPU instructions executed on a NXNS-patched resolver (BIND9.16.6) during a malicious query compared to a benign query. The number of instructions will be recorded by an instance of the callgrind tool in the command to start the resolver. We will refer to the cost of a NRDelegation query as the number of resolver CPU instructions executed during a malicious query.

Make sure the resolver is configured to use BIND9.16.6. Run `named -v` to check the version. If the resolver is using a different version, run:
```bash
cd /env/bind9_16_6
make install
```
to change the version to BIND9.16.6.

Turn on the resolver with Valgrind's callgrind tool by running
```bash
cd /etc
valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=mal_nxns_patched named -g -c /etc/named.conf
```
We use `--tool=callgrind` to specify that we are using the callgrind tool. `named` is the BIND9 service and `/etc/named.conf` is the configuration file.

The malicious referral response should include a long list of name servers, in order to create such a response, the `/env/nsd_attack/home.lan.forward` zone file needs to have 1500 records per one malicious request. From the Malicious server, run
```bash
cp /env/nsd_attack/home.lan.forward /env/nsd_attack/home.lan.forward.back
cp /env/reproduction/home.lan.forward /env/nsd_attack
```
to load the zone file for the malicious authoritative server. Then run 
```bash
cd /env/nsd_attack
nsd -c nsd.conf -d -f nsd.db
```
to turn on the attack server.

In the Root server terminal, run
```bash
cd /env/nsd_root
nsd -c nsd.conf -d -f nsd.db
```
to turn on the root server

From Client 1, query the resolver with a malicious query:
```bash
dig attack0.home.lan.
```
The malicious referral response contains 1500 records that delegate the resolution of `attack0.home.lan` to a DNS non-responsive server. You will not receive a resolution for the name `attack.home.lan` because the resolver was directed to resolve the name at a server incapable of responding to the DNS queries. Instead, you will see a message with `status: SERVFAIL`:
```
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: SERVFAIL, id: 26296
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1
```

Stop the resolver (Ctrl+C) and restart it with the Valgrind tool:
```bash
cd /etc
valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=benign_nxns_patched named -g -c /etc/named.conf
```

Now query the resolver with a legitimate query:
```bash
dig test.home.lan.
```
You should receive a response with the IP address of `test.home.lan` (127.0.0.252).
```
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;test.home.lan.                 IN      A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
test.home.lan.          86400   IN      A  127.0.0.252
```
After receiving the response, stop the resolver.

Next we'll copy the results files from the docker container to the host machine. From the host, run
```bash
sudo docker cp $CONTAINER_ID:/etc/mal_nxns_patched $(eval echo ~)/mal_nxns_patched
sudo docker cp $CONTAINER_ID:/etc/benign_nxns_patched $(eval echo ~)/benign_nxns_patched
done
```
After copying the files, run
```bash
sudo chown $USER $(eval echo ~)/mal_nxns_patched
sudo chown $USER $(eval echo ~)/benign_nxns_patched
```
to add permissions to open the files.

In Cloudlab, open the VNC window and run
```bash
sudo kcachegrind $(eval echo ~)/mal_nxns_patched
```
to open the malicious query results file with the KCachegrind tool. And run
```bash
sudo kcachegrind $(eval echo ~)/benign_nxns_patched
```
to open the benign query results file.

In the KCachegrind interface, make sure the "Relative" button is unchecked and choose the "Instructions Fetch" tab. Record the "Incl." value of the `fctx_getaddresses` function for both results files. Compare the results. The benign query should be around 200,000 instructions, while the malicious query should have more than 2,000,000,000.

### Instructions measurement experiment - NXNS-unpatched resolver

This experiment follows the instructions from the NXNS-patched experiment, but uses a BIND9.16.2 resolver, which is an NXNS-unpatched resolver, instead of a BIND9.16.6 resolver. 

To change the BIND9 version, run
```bash
cd /env/bind9_16_2
make install
```
to configure the resolver to use BIND9.16.2.

Turn on the resolver with Valgrind's callgrind tool by running
```bash
cd /etc
valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=mal_nxns_unpatched named -g -c /etc/named.conf
```

If the authoritative servers are not running, run 
```bash
cd /env/nsd_root
nsd -c nsd.conf -d -f nsd.db
```
to turn on the root and run
```bash
cd /env/nsd_attack
nsd -c nsd.conf -d -f nsd.db
```
to turn on the attack server. You can check if the `nsd` process is running with the `ps aux | grep nsd` command.

From Client 1, query the resolver with a malicious query:
```bash
dig attack0.home.lan.
```

Stop the resolver and restart it with the Valgrind tool:
```bash
cd /etc
valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=benign_nxns_unpatched named -g -c /etc/named.conf
```

Now query the resolver with the legitimate query:
```bash
dig test.home.lan
```
After receiving a response (IP address 127.0.0.252), stop the resolver.

Next we'll copy the results files from the docker container to the host machine. From the host, run
```bash
sudo docker cp $CONTAINER_ID:/etc/mal_nxns_unpatched $(eval echo ~)/mal_nxns_unpatched
sudo docker cp $CONTAINER_ID:/etc/benign_nxns_unpatched $(eval echo ~)/benign_nxns_unpatched
```
After copying the files, run
```bash
sudo chown $USER $(eval echo ~)/mal_nxns_unpatched
sudo chown $USER $(eval echo ~)/benign_nxns_unpatched
```
to add permissions to open the files.

In Cloudlab, open the VNC window and run
```bash
sudo kcachegrind $(eval echo ~)/mal_nxns_unpatched
```
to open the malicious query results file with the KCachegrind tool. And run
```bash
sudo kcachegrind $(eval echo ~)/benign_nxns_unpatched
```
to open the benign query results file.

In the KCachegrind GUI, make sure the "Relative" button is unchecked and choose the "Instructions Fetch" tab. Record the "Incl." value of the `fctx_getaddresses` function for both files. Compare the results. The benign query results should be around 200,000 instructions, while the malicious query should have around 200,000,000.

### Instructions measurement experiment - NRDelegation-patched resolver

This experiment will measure the instructions executed on a resolver implementation (BIND9.16.33) patched against the NRDelegationAttack.

To change the BIND9 version, run
```bash
cd /env/bind9_16_33
make install
```
to configure the resolver to use BIND9.16.33.

Turn on the resolver with Valgrind's callgrind tool by running
```bash
cd /etc
valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=mal_nrdelegation_patched named -g -c /etc/named.conf
```

If the authoritative servers are not turned on, run 
```bash
cd /env/nsd_root
nsd -c nsd.conf -d -f nsd.db
```
to turn on the root and run
```bash
cd /env/nsd_attack
nsd -c nsd.conf -d -f nsd.db
```
to turn on the attack server.

From Client 1, query the resolver with a malicious query:
```bash
dig attack0.home.lan.
```

Once the malicious name resolution fails, stop the resolver and restart it with the Valgrind tool:
```bash
cd /etc
valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=benign_nrdelegation_patched named -g -c /etc/named.conf
```

Now query the resolver with the legitimate query:
```bash
dig test.home.lan
```
After receiving a response (IP address 127.0.0.252), stop the resolver.

Next we'll copy the results files from the docker container to the host machine. From the host, run
```bash
sudo docker cp $CONTAINER_ID:/etc/mal_nrdelegation_patched $(eval echo ~)/mal_nrdelegation_patched
sudo docker cp $CONTAINER_ID:/etc/benign_nrdelegation_patched $(eval echo ~)/benign_nrdelegation_patched
```
After copying the files, run
```bash
sudo chown $USER $(eval echo ~)/mal_nrdelegation_patched
sudo chown $USER $(eval echo ~)/benign_nrdelegation_patched
```
to add permissions to open the files.

In Cloudlab, open the VNC window and run
```bash
sudo kcachegrind $(eval echo ~)/mal_nrdelegation_patched
```
to open the malicious query results file with the KCachegrind tool. And run
```bash
sudo kcachegrind $(eval echo ~)/benign_nrdelegation_patched
```
to open the benign query results file.

Make sure the "Relative" button is unchecked and choose the "Instructions Fetch" tab. Record the "Incl." value of the `fctx_getaddresses` function for both files. Compare the results. The benign query results should be around 200,000 instructions, while the malicious query should have around 10,000,000.

### Instructions measurement - referral list length

So far, our experiments used a referral response list with 1500 NS names per malicious query (i.e. the referral response delegates the resolution of attack0.home.lan. to 1500 different NS names). We can modify the malicious referral list size, e.g. 100, 500, 1000 records per malicious queries, and test the cost of a malicious query.

To edit the file that generates the referral response, run:
```
sudo nano /env/reproduction/genAttackers.py
```
and change the range in line 6 (`for i in range(1500)`) to your desired value. Write out, exit the editor, and run
```
python /env/reproduction/genAttackers.py
```
to run the updated script that generates the output file `attackerNameServers.txt` with the referral list. Next run
```
cp /env/nsd_attack/home.lan.forward.bak /env/nsd_attack/home.lan.forward
sed -i '/ns2        IN     A    127.0.0.201/r attackerNameServers.txt' /env/nsd_attack/home.lan.forward
```
to update the malicious server zone file with the new referral response list.

You now can perform the instructions measurment experiments again to explore how the cost of a query varies with the number of referrals. Repeat the previous steps to change the number of referrals to another value. 

After you have performed the experiments for different numbers of referrals, you can generate a graphical representation of your data. Create a .py file and copy and paste the following code into the file:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate points
