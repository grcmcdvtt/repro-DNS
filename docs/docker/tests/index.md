We will refer to the cost of a NRDelegation query as the number of resolver CPU instructions executed during a malicious query. The NRDelegation attack is harmful because a single query costs significantly more than a benign query. This experiment will measure the cost of malicious and benign queries on a NXNS-patched resolver (BIND9.16.6), a NXNS-unpatched resolver (BIND9.16.2), and a NRDelegation-patched resolver (9.16.33).
