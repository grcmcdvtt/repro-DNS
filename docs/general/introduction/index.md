# Reproducing NRDelegationAttack: a DDoS attack on DNS
<!-- start with an intro paragraph - what we'll do, what the prerequisites are -->

This experiment is a reproduction of the major claims presented in Afek et al. [1] and will measure the cost of the NRDelegation distributed-denial-of-service attack on the resolver CPU load and its effect on benign clients. 

This experiment uses two setups, one using Docker containers and one using Virtual Machines (VMs).

You can run this experiment on Cloudlab. To reproduce this experiment on Cloudlab, you will need an account on Cloudlab, you will need to have joined a project, and you will need to have set up SSH access.
